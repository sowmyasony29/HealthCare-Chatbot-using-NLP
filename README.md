# HealthCare Chatbot using - Natural Language Processing(NLP)
Abstract
In today's interconnected world, accessing timely healthcare services is often hindered by long wait times, geographical barriers, and a shortage of healthcare professionals. This project introduces a Healthcare Chatbot leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to address these challenges. Deployed using Flask, the chatbot offers immediate medical guidance by understanding user inquiries and providing tailored responses. This system aims to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare resources, especially in rural or underserved areas.

# Key Features
Immediate Response: Provides instant medical guidance, reducing wait times.
Symptom Assessment: Assists users in identifying potential health conditions based on their symptoms.
Doctor Locator: Recommends nearby doctors based on the user's pin code.
Conversational Interface: Engages users through a natural, text-based chat interface.
Flask Deployment: Ensures scalable and easy-to-integrate web applications.

Code Details
1.server.py:

This file contains the Flask web server, which routes user requests and sends responses based on chatbot logic.
Handles different user inputs, generates responses using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity, and communicates with the database.
2.train.py:

This file is responsible for training the chatbot, including text preprocessing and the generation of response patterns.
Uses files like symptom.txt and pincodes.txt to prepare datasets and extract features.
The trained model can then be used to predict responses based on user queries.
3.requirements.txt:

This file lists all the necessary libraries and tools required to run the chatbot system. You can install these dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
4.templates/index.html:

This HTML file provides the user interface for the chatbot. Users can enter queries, and the responses are displayed here.
5.data/:

Contains important text files (symptom.txt and pincodes.txt) that store data on symptoms, diseases, treatments, and doctor information.

# System Architecture
## 1. Data Processing:
Input Files:
symptom.txt: Contains descriptions of health conditions, treatments, and dietary advice.
pincodes.txt: Contains doctor information based on pin codes.
Text Preprocessing:
Tokenization: Splits text into words.
Lemmatization: Reduces words to their root forms.
Stop-word Removal: Eliminates common, insignificant words.
## 2. User Interaction:
Greeting Detection: Responds to greetings like "hello" or "hi."
Symptom Analysis: Assesses user-provided symptoms and suggests possible conditions.
Doctor Recommendations: Finds nearby specialists based on the provided pin code.
## 3. Response Generation:
TF-IDF Vectorization: Measures the importance of words within the dataset.
Cosine Similarity: Calculates similarity between user input and stored responses to identify the most accurate reply.
## How It Works
User Input: The chatbot processes user queries and identifies relevant keywords.
Text Processing: Utilizes NLP techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.
Similarity Analysis: Computes the similarity score using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.
Response Delivery: Generates a tailored response based on the highest similarity score.
Doctor Search: Users can input their pin code to find nearby doctors from the pincodes.txt dataset.
Dataset Details
symptom.txt: Contains information on 29 health conditions, including:
Predicted diseases
Suggested treatments and medications
Dietary advice
pincodes.txt: Provides contact details and specialization of doctors for various pin codes.
# NLP Techniques Used
## Tokenization: Splits sentences into individual words.
## Lemmatization: Converts words to their base forms for consistent processing.
## Stop-word Removal: Removes common words to focus on meaningful content.
## Feature Extraction (TF-IDF): Ranks words based on their importance in the dataset.
Conclusion
The Healthcare Chatbot demonstrates the potential of NLP and AI in enhancing healthcare accessibility. By providing instant medical guidance, symptom analysis, and doctor recommendations, it bridges the gap between patients and healthcare professionals, particularly in remote areas. Future improvements include expanding the database, refining algorithms, and enhancing the chatbot’s diagnostic accuracy through continuous learning.
